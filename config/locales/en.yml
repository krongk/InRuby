    t2: "Ruby on Rails Trainning"
    s2: "It is a well known fact that Ruby on Rails is gaining quite a bit of popularity among developers and deployers of Web applications and for good reasons.
        Rails is considered a well thought out Web application framework based on several design principles such as Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) and Convention Over Configuration,
        which enable an agile yet practical development and deployment environment for Web applications.
        Rails also leverages the power of the Ruby language,
        which provides simple and consistent syntax with powerful language features such as blocks, closures, and meta-programming.
